I'm a data enthusiastic (somedays working as data analyst somedays as data engineer and other days as data scientist) with electronics and information systems engineering, with a strong math and statistics background. 
I'm half Argentinian :argentina: half Italian :italy:.
I play bass, guitar and drums but I'm not good at singing.
When I'm not diving across data lakes or data oceans, I enjoy traveling, go hiking, climbing mountains and making music or reparing my musician gear.

My favorite quote: *"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"* - Michelangelo
