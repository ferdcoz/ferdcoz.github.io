I'm a data scientist wit electronics and information systems engineering background. 

I'm half Argentinian half Italian.

I play bass, guitar and drums but I'm not good at singing.

I like hiking and climbing mountains whenever I have free time.

My favorite quote: *"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"* - Michelangelo
