Hello world! I avoid putting labels to people, so for the sake of this site let's say I consider myself belonging to the 'data enthusiastic' cluster (somedays working as data analyst somedays as data engineer and other days as data scientist) with electronics, information systems engineering, math and statistics background.

I play bass, electric guitar and drums but I'm not good at singing. When I'm not diving across data lakes or data oceans, I enjoy travelling, go hiking, climbing mountains and making music or reparing my musician gear.

I'm half Argentinian and half Italian (dual citizenship) and that's the reason why I love the combination of a nice and soft homemade traditional pasta and a good malbec glass of wine from Mendoza.

My favorite quote: *"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"* - Michelangelo
